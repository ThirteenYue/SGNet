</p>
(a) Overall architecture of SGNet. (b) The three-dimensional sparse attention (TDSA) module for focusing on inter-class ambiguous features. (c) The multi-path residual perception (MPRP) module for cross-scale feature interaction. (d) The SAM prior knowledge fusion (SPKF) module that leverages SAM’s generalized regional priors to guide fine-grained defect recognition.

## Requirements
Install from the ```requirements.txt``` using:
```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
*Note: If you have some problems with the code, the [issues](https://github.com/ThirteenYue/SGNet/issues) may help.*
